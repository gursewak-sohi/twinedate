                    <p><em>Web Beacons:</em> We use Web beacons, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, to demonstrate that a webpage or email address was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked. </p>

                    <p>We will take reasonable measures (e.g., by contract) to require that any party receiving any of your personal information from us, including for purposes of providing the App, undertakes to: (i) retain and use such information only for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy; (ii) not disclose your personal information except with your consent, as permitted by applicable law, or as permitted by this Privacy Policy; and (iii) generally protect the privacy of your personal information.</p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p><strong>YOUR CHOICES</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Update Information</em>: If the personal information we have for you changes, you may correct, update, or delete it by contacting us as set forth in Section XV of this Privacy Policy. You may correct, update, or delete some of their personal information directly in your account on the App. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process all such requests in a timely manner. You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in our databases.  Additionally, we will retain and use your information (or copies thereof) as necessary to comply with our legal and/or regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><em>Marketing Communications: </em>You may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of any of our marketing emails. Please note that you cannot opt out of receiving transactional e-mails.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><em>Cookie Management</em>: Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies.  To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings.  Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings.  Please note that if you set your browser to disable cookies or other Tracking Technologies, the App may not work properly.  For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your browser and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org. </p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p>You will need to apply these opt-out settings on each device from which you wish to opt-out.  We cannot offer any assurances as to whether the companies we work with participate in the opt-out programs described above. </p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p><strong>How We Protect the Information</strong></p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p>We take commercially reasonable steps to protect your information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.  Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable.  We cannot guarantee the security of our databases or the databases of the third parties with which we may share such information, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet.  In particular, e-mail sent to us may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.  </p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p><strong>External Sites</strong></p>
                    <p>The App may also contain hyperlinks to other third-party websites or apps (“External Websites”).  We have no control over the privacy practices or the content of any of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors, or External Websites to which we provide hyperlinks. As such, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of those External Websites. You should check the applicable third-party privacy policy and terms of use when visiting any External Websites. </p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p><strong>Children’s Information</strong></p>
                    <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18 through the App. If you are under 18, please do not give us any personal information.  We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information through the App without their permission.  If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided personal information to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong>Important Notice to Non-U.S. Residents</strong><br></p>
                    <p>The App and its servers are operated in the United States.  If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that your information, including your personal information, may be transferred to, processed, maintained, and used on computers, servers, and systems located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your country of origin. If you are located outside the United States and choose to use the App, you consent to any transfer and processing of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and you do so at your own risk.<br></p>
                    <p>‍</p>
                    <p><strong>DO  NOT TRACK</strong><br></p>
                    <p>As discussed above, third parties such as advertising networks and analytics providers may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you access or use the App. Currently, various browsers offer a “Do Not Track” option, but there is no standard for commercial websites. At this time, we do not monitor, recognize, or honor any opt-out or do not track mechanisms, including general web browser “Do Not Track” settings and/or signals.</p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p><strong>Retention of Information</strong></p>
                    <p>We will retain your personal information for as long as it serves the purpose(s) for which it was initially collected as stated in this Privacy Policy or subsequently authorized. Additionally, we will retain and use your information (or copies thereof) as necessary to comply with our legal and/or regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. </p>
